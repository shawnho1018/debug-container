## Debug-Container Project
This project is inspired by Phil Huang's [debug-container](https://github.com/pichuang/debug-container) project. 
The only difference is this project is using Photon-OS as the base image and the resulting image is around 156MB. Engineer could easily bring this container to POC site for troubleshooting unknown problems in customer's air-gapped environment. Simply docker save/load this image.
